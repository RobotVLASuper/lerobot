# Installation

TODO(pepijn): Compare installation method description and other descriptions with transformers/datasets docs

Download our source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
```

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10, e.g. with [`miniconda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html):
```bash
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10
```

Then activate your conda environment, you have to do this each time you open a shell to use lerobot:
```bash
conda activate lerobot
```

When using `miniconda`, if you don't have `ffmpeg` in your environment:
```bash
conda install ffmpeg
```

Install ðŸ¤— LeRobot:
```bash
pip install --no-binary=av -e .
```

> [!NOTE] If you encounter build errors, you may need to install additional dependencies (`cmake`, `build-essential`, and `ffmpeg libs`). On Linux, run:
> `sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential python-dev pkg-config libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev pkg-config`. For other systems, see: [Compiling PyAV](https://pyav.org/docs/develop/overview/installation.html#bring-your-own-ffmpeg)

For simulations, ðŸ¤— LeRobot comes with gymnasium environments that can be installed as extras:
- [aloha](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-aloha)
- [xarm](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-xarm)
- [pusht](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-pusht)

For instance, to install ðŸ¤— LeRobot with aloha and pusht, use:
```bash
pip install --no-binary=av -e ".[aloha, pusht]"
```

To use [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for experiment tracking, log in with
```bash
wandb login
```
